# Vectors and arrays are specified as a list of numbers in square brackets:

# the square brackets are MANDATORY.

# The displacement in this example intentionally leads to an impossible
# geometry, resulting in a non-zero epsilon.  By enabling optimisation near
# the end of this file "optimisation enabled = yes" you can have the optimiser
# tweak the configuration to find a realistic solution.  Parameters with a
# large optimisation weight will be altered considerably more by the optimiser
# than parameters with small optimisation weights.  A zero optimisation weight
# prevents the optimiser from modifying a certain parameter, even if it means
# that no realistic solutions are possible as a result of the constraint.
